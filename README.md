### Identifiers:
 A Name is concerned as identifier in java program. It can be a name of a class, method , variable or label name.
 ``` Note: ``` Predefined class name like ```String``` are also identifier. 
 For example,
 ```xml
String x=10;
```
Here theres's two identifiers, ```String``` and ```x```.


Roles for defining Java identifier,

1. Only allowed characters in java identifiers are,
- A-Z
- a-z
- 0-9
- _
-$
If we use any other chars, we'll get compile time ```error```

2. Identifiers can not start with digit

```total123``` is valid but ```123Total``` is not valid.

3. Java identifiers are case sensative as java is a case sensative programming language.

4. There's no length limit for java identifiers

5. We can't use reserved words as identifiers.
For example,

``` int if=12;``` is not valid as ```if ``` is a reserved word. It'll through compile time error.
6. Predefined class name and interface name can be use as identifiers but it is not recommended.

For example,

``` int Runnable=5;```
It's not gonna through any error or exception.
 

### Reserved words

In java theres only ```53``` reserved words. Reserved words are there to represent meaning of functionality.

From these ```53``` there's ```50``` ```keywords``` and ```3``` ```Literals```.  

What is a ```Keyword```?
If the ```reserved``` words represents any functionality, then it's a ```keyword```.
From these ```50``` ```keywords``` ```48``` are ```used keyword```.
List of ```unused keyword```
- goto
- const

What is a ```literal```?
If the ```reserved``` words represents any value, then it's a ```literal```

### Data types
Theres 8 data type,
- byte
- short

### Flow control keywords
There's 11 flow control keywords.
- if
- else
- switch

- break
- continue
- return 

### modifiers keywords
There's 11 modifiers in java , including ```default``` , the number is 12.
- public
- private
- default
- protected
- static
- final
- abstract
- synchronized
- native
- strictfp
- transient
- volatile


### Exception handling keywords
There's 6 exception handling keywords,

- try
- catch
- throw
- throws
- finnaly
- assert

### Class related keywords
There's 6 Class related keywords,

- class
- interface
- extends
- implements
- package
- import

### Object related keywords
There's 4 Object related keywords,

- new
- instanceof
- super
- this

### Return type keyword
There's 4 Return type keywords,

- void

### enum keywords
There's 4 enum type keywords,
-enum

### Data types
Java languange is strongly typed language. Every variable and expression must have some type.

Java is not a pure oo language as, 
- there are primitive data types (8), int, double, long, byte, short, float,double,boolean, char.
- java doesn't support operator overloading.
- there is no support of multiple inheritance.

Peimitive data type's are divided into 2 parts, numeric and non-numeric. 

Non-numeric primitive data types,
- char ( size: 2 bytes as it is unicode basis (2 bytes, 0 to 65536 options, java supports all language chars ), in c or c++ it is 1 byte as they are ascii char based (1 byte, 0 to 256 options) only) 
- boolean (size n/a as it depends on VM; Java boolean throughs compile time error for 0 and 1, it can only hold true or false)

numeric data types are divided into further 2 sections,integral and floating point.

Integral data types,
- byte (singed; positive and negative, 1 byte (8 bits), range: -128 to 127)
- short ( signed; 2 bytes(16 bits), range: - 32768 to 32767)
- int (signed; 4 bytes(32 bits), range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483, 647)
- long (signed; 8 bytes(64 bits), range: 	-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807)

Floating point data types,
- double ( 8 bytes (64 bits), range: Â±1.79769313486231570E+308 , we want 14-15 decimal places,double precicion) 
- float ( 4 bytes (32 bits), range:,-1.7X10^38 to 1.7X10^38, we want 5-6 decimal places, single precicion)

```Note```:  ```null``` is only applicable for object type. It is the default value of object reference. we can't use it for primitives.



### Java literals

Literal is a constant assigned to the variable. 

```
int a= 10;
```
Here,

``` int ``` -----> Data type
``` a ```  -----> identifier/variable
``` = ``` -----> operator
``` 10 ``` -----> constant (Literal)
``` ; ``` -----> Specific symbol/ terminator

Java provided the following literals,

#### Integral/ Integer literals
 byte, short, int, long --> 10,20
 char --> 'a','b'

#### Floating point literals
 float --> 22.12f, 23.34f
 double --> 2324.234,23434.3435D

#### Boolean Literal
 boolean --> true, false

#### String literal
String --> "abc", "10","true"

To improve readability in Literals, java 7 supports a special notation '_' 

For example, 

```
double d=123456789.234;
```
You can write the above double declaration like following,

```
double d=12_34_56_789.334;  (12 core, 34 lakh,56 thousand, 789.234)
```
