### Identifiers:
 A Name is concerned as identifier in java program. It can be a name of a class, method , variable or label name.
 ``` Note: ``` Predefined class name like ```String``` are also identifier. 
 For example,
 ```xml
String x=10;
```
Here theres's two identifiers, ```String``` and ```x```.


Roles for defining Java identifier,

1. Only allowed characters in java identifiers are,
- A-Z
- a-z
- 0-9
- _
-$
If we use any other chars, we'll get compile time ```error```

2. Identifiers can not start with digit

```total123``` is valid but ```123Total``` is not valid.

3. Java identifiers are case sensative as java is a case sensative programming language.

4. There's no length limit for java identifiers

5. We can't use reserved words as identifiers.
For example,

``` int if=12;``` is not valid as ```if ``` is a reserved word. It'll through compile time error.
6. Predefined class name and interface name can be use as identifiers but it is not recommended.

For example,

``` int Runnable=5;```
It's not gonna through any error or exception.
